# Feedforward Neural Network Training with wandb

This repository contains a Python script (`train.py`) that trains a NumPy‑only feedforward neural network on MNIST or Fashion‑MNIST. The code supports various optimizers and hyperparameters, logs training and evaluation metrics to Weights & Biases (wandb), and is configurable via command‑line arguments.

## GitHub Repository

The complete source code is available on GitHub:  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name)

## Code Organization

- **train.py**  
  This is the main training script. It:
  - Parses command‑line arguments for hyperparameters (e.g., epochs, batch size, loss, optimizer, learning rate, etc.).
  - Checks if the wandb API key is available; if not, prompts the user to enter it.
  - Loads the chosen dataset (MNIST or Fashion‑MNIST), pre-processes the data, and splits it into training, validation, and test sets.
  - Defines a NumPy‑only feedforward neural network (MLP) and various optimizer classes (SGD, Momentum, Nesterov, RMSProp, Adam, Nadam).
  - Trains the model while logging metrics to wandb.

- **README.md**  
  This file provides instructions on how to run the code, a link to the wandb report, and links to screenshots and demo videos.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed along with the following packages:

- numpy
- wandb
- keras (or tensorflow which includes keras)
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy wandb tensorflow scikit-learn
```

### Running the Script

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name.git
   cd your_repo_name
   ```

2. **Run the Training Script:**

   The script is run from the command line. The first time you run it, you will be prompted for your wandb API key. After that, the key is stored in your `~/.netrc` file.

   Example command:

   ```bash
   python train.py --wandb_entity deepak_singh_ma23m006-iit-madras --wandb_project myprojectname
   ```

   **Detailed CLI Procedure:**

   - Open a terminal and navigate to the repository directory.
   - Execute the command above.
   - When prompted, paste your wandb API key (this is only required once).
   - The script will then load the dataset, build the model, and start training for the default 10 epochs.
   - Training progress (train loss, validation loss, validation accuracy, and test accuracy) will be printed in the terminal and logged to wandb.
   - Once training completes, the final test accuracy is printed.

3. **Customizing Hyperparameters:**

   You can override default hyperparameters using command‑line arguments. For example:

   ```bash
   python train.py --wandb_entity deepak_singh_ma23m006-iit-madras --wandb_project myprojectname --dataset mnist --epochs 20 --batch_size 32 --loss cross_entropy --optimizer adam --learning_rate 0.001 --num_layers 4 --hidden_size 128 --activation ReLU
   ```

   Run `python train.py --help` to view all available options.

## Conclusion

This repository demonstrates how to configure and train a feedforward neural network using a fully configurable Python script with wandb integration. The script logs all relevant training metrics to wandb, making it easy to track experiments, compare hyperparameter settings, and visualize results in real-time.
